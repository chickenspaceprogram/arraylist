# arraylist

An implementation of an ArrayList in C. This is intended for my personal usage, apologies for the lackluster documentation.

This implementation isn't great. It's a modified form of an earlier implementation of a stack that I wrote and I'm far too lazy to make something decent. So I have this. You can put elements onto the end of it with `push`, remove elements from the end with `pop`, peek at the last element with `peek` (you can tell this was copy-pasted directly from the stack implementation, can't you), see the number of elements with `getSize`, and free the ArrayList with `free`.
